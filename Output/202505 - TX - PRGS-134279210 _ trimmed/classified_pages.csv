Respond By Date 06/18/2025
     Dear Scott Phillips,
     Introduction:
     Objection 1
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Some of the coverages included in the indication show significant credibility-weighted indicated rate decreases with
no change selected.  Please explain the rationale for maintaining the current rate level for these coverages when prior experience
appears to indicate that rates should be reduced for these coverages.
In crafting a response, please keep in mind that we do not typically permit base rates cross-subsidizing between coverages. It is
generally not appropriate to select significant increases for positive indications while taking minimal or no decreases for negative
indications. Among BIPD, COLL, COMP, and UM/UIM, the companys largest coverages in written premium, this cross-subsidizing
appears in the selections.
     Objection 2
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: The methodology used in the companys trend selections is unclear. Please clarify the process through which the
company selected their loss and premium trends, both historic and future.
     Objection 3
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Please provide a data dictionary that lists each variable, defines it, states role (dependent, independent, control).
Please also include a definition for each level of the variables.
     Objection 4
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Please describe any offsets or other adjustments to variables used in the model.
     Objection 5
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Some of the exhibits include confidence intervals, but some do not. Further, most documents do not include the
current factors. Please amend the exhibits to include, current, indicated, proposed, and confidence intervals on each table.
     Objection 6
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Please clarify how confidence intervals were determined and what statistic was used. For those variables for which
confidence intervals are not available, please clarify why.
     Objection 7
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the Annual Mileage tables, please respond to the following:
* Many levels in this table have an indicated relativity of NA. Please clarify why these are marked as NA.
* Most of the Unverified levels have 0% credibility and an indicated factor of 0. Please clarify why this is the case.

7,correspondence,0.95,Contains objections and requests for clarification from a regulator.,"* Please clarify if the company has binned any levels together when running the model.
* For those levels in which the company has no indicated factor, please clarify how the company selected a factor.
     Objection 8
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the Business Class Body Type Use Class tables, please respond to the following:
* Please clarify how the Business Class Body Type Use code can be interpreted. For example, what does 078034N denote? If the
company has previously filed these rules, please state where it has been filed.
* The company only provided an indicated and selected relativity. Please amend the table in accordance with Objection 5 or clarify
why only the indicated and selected relativities are available.
* Several variables have the same indicated factor but different selected factors. Please explain how the final factors were selected.
     Objection 9
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the DOT interaction tables, please respond to the following:
* Please explain if the company has binned any variables prior to running the model.
* Many levels in this table have an indicated relativity of NA. Please clarify why these are marked as NA.
     Objection 10
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the Length of Prior/Carrier Continuous tables, please respond to the following:

     Objection 11
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the Model Year tables, please respond to the following:
* Please explain if the company has binned any variables prior to running the model.
* Some of the selected variables are outside the confidence intervals. Please clarify why the companys selection process would result
in these selections.
     Objection 12
          - Actuarial Support (Supporting Document)
          Comments: Regarding the Out of State Driver tables, please respond to the following:
* Please clarify if the company has binned any levels together when running the model.
* Some of the selected factors are outside the confidence intervals. For example, for BCG A, the company appears to have assigned
a factor of 1.34 to policies with more than half of drivers out of state. However, the highest point on the confidence interval is 1.31.
This can be seen at other points in the table. Please explain how the company selected the factors.

A. Body Type Rule (V01)

These trailers will be assigned to 10 (Dry Freight Trailer).  Policyholders will be notified of 
the change and given the option to select a different Body Type. 
2. Body Type changes will require the assignment of a new category for some vehicles.  
The new assignment is based on the following criteria: 
a.  Tow Trucks with one axle (Body Type 4) and < 26k GVW will be assigned to 4A.  
All other Tow Trucks with one axle will be assigned to 4B. 
b. Limousines (Body Type 37) where the stretch length is known will be reassigned 
to 39 if the stretch length is between 121-180 inches and to 49 if the stretch 
length is > 180 inches. 
c. Luxury SUVs (Body Type 32) will be reassigned to 34. 
3. Pickup Trucks (Body Types 5, 5A, 5B, 55) will be reassigned a body type depending on 
the type of trailer hitch and size of the vehicle. 
a. If the trailer hitch is a fifth wheel, ball in bed, or gooseneck, then the body type is 
61; else 
b. if the trailer hitch is a tow boom, then the body type is 4A when GVW = 0-26k and 
the body type is 4B when GVW > 26k; else 
c. if the trailer hitch is ball at bumper or there is no trailer hitch, then Pickup Trucks 
> 1/2 Ton (Body Types 5B, 55) and GVW > 16k will be reassigned to 61. 
 
 
B. Accidents and Violations Counts Rule (G08) 
Accidents and violations previously removed from the driving record prior to the first renewal after this 
rule takes effect because the occurrence date exceeded the Chargeable Period for Points 
Assignment (Rule DR06) and Class F accidents (Rule G08) that were previously not rated, will not be 
counted, unless the accident or violation is returned on a Motor Vehicle Report and is between the 
Chargeable Period for Points Assignment (Rule DR06) and Accident and Violation Evaluation Period 
(Rule DR06). 
 
C. Non-owned Trailer Physical Damage Coverage 
Policies will be moved to the new policy-level coverage.  The initial renewal rate transition is not 
subject to Rule G11. The limit/deductible option will be calculated as follows: 
 If the current deductible is ≤ $1,000, then the new deductible is $1,000.  Otherwise 
the new deductible is $2,000. 
 Round the current Stated Amount value up to the next highest limit level, capped at 
$80,000."
