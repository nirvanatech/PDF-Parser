     Dear Paula Rossman,
     Introduction:
          RESPOND BY: 08/14/2024
In order for us to continue our review, please submit a complete response by the date shown above.
     Objection 1
          Comments: Regarding response 7 of the previous letter, provide further details regarding the review of the insured's IFTAs and
inspection patterns for reasonability of the weighted average radius class. Explain what the IFTA is and how reviewing it can support
the stated expected mileage within each radius class.
     Objection 2
          Comments: Provide further details around how and when the expected mileage within each radius classification can change or
be updated for a particular vehicle. In particular, clarify whether the expected mileage within each radius can change
1.) On midterm amendment
2.) On audit
3.) On renewal or rewrite.
Revise and supersede as necessary.
     Objection 3
          Comments: The previous response to objection 4 is viewed as incomplete. The attached lift chart shows the lift using quintiles,
but the factors vary down to the centile level.
Provide additional details and support for the specific tier factors. Include all data, methods, and assumptions used in selecting the
tier factors.

               This is a question we ask on our application, and our expectation is that the agent of the insured will be familiar with the insureds mileage/patterns of operations. We
also may review the insureds IFTAs and pattern of inspections for reasonability in light of what is provided in the application.
     Related Objection 7
          Comments:  The expected mileage within each radius classification used in the weighted average radius/zone rule appears subjective and thus potentially unfairly
discriminatory.
Provide a more detailed description regarding how the expected mileage within each radius is determined to demonstrate that the weighted average radius is determined in an
objective, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive manner. Revise and supersede accordingly.

          Comments:
               Average Number of Relevant Claims is based on the claim history of a policyholder prior to the policy effective date, which is unavailable for a newly established
business entity. The category of Unknown is for this type of policyholders and 0 is inappropriate in this situation since it should be essentially different from policyholder with
insurance history and 0 claims.

CRR Driver Quality Factor - 1 Edition 08 24 
 
 
DRIVER QUALITY FACTOR 
A Driver Quality Factor will be applied multiplicatively to Liability, No Fault, Medical Payments, Comprehensive, 
Specified Causes of Loss, and Collision coverages.  This is applicable only to Trucks Tractors and Trailers, and will 
not be modified because of midterm changes. 
The following variables are used in determining the Driver Quality Factor: 
• Driver Experience: Years of driving experience for each driver 
• Motor Vehicle Record (MVR): Considers driver violations and incidents related to each driver 
The Driver Quality Factor is calculated as: 
Driver Quality Factor = 
   (Average Driver Quality Score x Number of Listed Drivers + 1.15 x Number of Undisclosed Drivers) 
/ (Number of Listed Drivers + Number of Undisclosed Drivers) 
Where, 
Average Driver Quality Score = Average Driver Experience Score Factor 
           x Average MVR Score Factor 
Average Driver Experience Score = Average (Driver Experience Score for each driver) 
Average MVR Score = Average (Number of Super & Major Violations Factor 
           x Number of Minor Violations Factor 
           x Number of Other Administrative Violations Factor 
           x Number of Findings of Defective Equipment Factor 
           x Number of Incidents Factor 
           x Number of Months Since Last Incident Factor) 
The Driver Quality Factor calculated above will be applied to Liability, No Fault, Medical Payments, and Collision 
coverages. For Comprehensive and Specified Causes of Loss coverages, apply the following factor: 
Driver Quality Factor – Comprehensive = 0.25 x Driver Quality Factor + 0.75 x 1.000",1.0,rule,0.95,

DRIVER QUALITY FACTOR 
A Driver Quality Factor will be applied multiplicatively to Liability, No Fault, Medical Payments, Comprehensive, 
Specified Causes of Loss, and Collision coverages.  This is applicable only to Trucks Tractors and Trailers, and will 
not be modified because of midterm changes. 
The following variables are used in determining the Driver Quality Factor: 
• Driver Experience: Years of driving experience for each driver 
• Motor Vehicle Record (MVR): Considers driver violations and incidents related to each driver 
The Driver Quality Factor is calculated as: 
Driver Quality Factor = 
   (Average Driver Quality Score x Number of Listed Drivers + 1.15 x Number of Undisclosed Drivers) 
/ (Number of Listed Drivers + Number of Undisclosed Drivers) 
Where, 
Average Driver Quality Score = Average Driver Experience Score Factor 
           x Average MVR Score Factor 
Average Driver Experience Score = Average (Driver Experience Score for each driver) 
Average MVR Score = Average (Number of Super & Major Violations Factor 
           x Number of Minor Violations Factor 
           x Number of Other Administrative Violations Factor 
           x Number of Findings of Defective Equipment Factor 
           x Number of Incidents Factor 
           x Number of Months Since Last Incident Factor) 
The Driver Quality Factor calculated above will be applied to Liability, No Fault, Medical Payments, and Collision 
coverages. For Comprehensive and Specified Causes of Loss coverages, apply the following factor: 
Driver Quality Factor – Comprehensive = 0.25 x Driver Quality Factor + 0.75 x 1.000",1.0,rule,0.95,

WEIGHTED AVERAGE RADIUS / ZONE RULE 
 
A.  For each Truck, Tractor or Trailer, the premium will be the average of the local, intermediate and 
long distance premiums for that vehicle weighted by the expected distribution of mileage by 
radius for the upcoming policy term. 
B. Local and intermediate radii will be determined as set forth in Rules 22 and 23. 
C. For long distance radius will be determined as set forth in Rule 25. 
D. This rule will be applicable to Liability, Pollution Liability, Comprehensive, Specified Causes of 
Loss, and Collision coverages. 
E. Example: 
1. Vehicle A is garaged in zip 12345 Terr 123 in XX state.  The annual mileage for Vehicle A is 
100,000.  Vehicle A is expected to have 25,000 miles within the local radius, 25,000 miles 
within the intermediate radius, and 50,000 miles long distance. 
2. The premium would be calculated as follows: 
(Final liability premium for Vehicle A rated as local)*25,000/100,000 
+ (Final liability premium for Vehicle A rated as intermediate)*25,000/100,000 
+ (Final liability premium for Vehicle A rated as long-distance)*50,000/100,000

Loss Cost Calculation for BSB Small Trucking Zone Rating 
 
1. Background 
The loss cost of zone rating for BSB Small Trucking product is implemented at the level of pairs of 
states and 5-digit zip-codes, instead of pairs of the garaging zones and destination zones defined by 
ISO. Therefore, in implementation, a table, with US state name and 5-digit zip-code as the look-up 
key and the loss costs as the look-up values, is created for each coverage of liability, collision, 
comprehensive, and medical expense and for states where each coverage type applies. 
2. Development 
Step1. For each zip code, collect all the inspections that were performed between 2021-01-01 and 
2023-12-31, pertaining to active DOT numbers found in Federal Moter Carrier Safety Administration 
(FMCSA) database as of 2023-12-31. 
Step 2. Look up for the garaging zone for this zip code and the destination zone for the county where 
each of these inspections took place. Then a list of pairs of garaging zone and destination zone was 
created, where the garaging zone is the same. 
Step3. Look up for the loss cost for each item in the list created in step 2, from original ISO’s zone 
rating loss cost table and then calculate the straight average, called the raw zip-code loss cost. 
Step 4. Smooth the raw zip code loss cost. There are three situations: 
a. If a zip code has neighboring zip codes that are located within 10 miles, where the 
distance is the great circle distance between centroids, select the top 5 closest ones. 
Calculate the weighted average of the raw loss cost with the count of inspections of 
each zip code as the weight. The result is called smoothed loss cost. 
b. If zip code does not have any neighboring zip codes that meet the criteria in (a), 
calculate the weighted average of raw loss cost for all zip codes from the same county, 
where the weight is the count of inspections. The result is called county loss cost. 
c. If there are no inspections that are found from the county, calculate the weighted 
average among all the zip codes from the state. The result if called state loss cost. 
Step 6. If smoothed loss cost is available, select it. Otherwise select county loss cost if it is 
available and select state loss cost if not. The result is called the BSB zone rating loss cost at zip 
code level. 
3. Implementation 
In rating, use BSB zone loss cost at zip code level if a pair of state and zip code is found in the 
lookup tables. Otherwise use state loss cost.",1.0,actuarial support,0.95,

Applies To: 
Comments: 
Provide support for the underwriting tier factors.

69,"Objection 1   
Applies To: 
Comments: 
Regarding response 7 of the previous letter, provide further details regarding the review of the 
insured's IFTAs and inspection patterns for reasonability of the weighted average radius class. 
Explain what the IFTA is and how reviewing it can support the stated expected mileage within each 
radius class. 
 
IFTA stands for International Fuel Tax Agreement, which requires carriers to file a quarterly fuel tax report 
that details mileage information for each state. These IFTA reports are a standardized industry tool used 
to verify the mileage data provided by the insureds. Additionally, underwriters can review  locations 
where inspections happened as available in the  data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA). With IFTA reports and FMCSA inspection data, underwriters can cross-validate 
the radius information provided by the insureds on their applications , by calculating the distance 
between the garaging location and the data shown on the IFTA reports and inspection patterns. 
 
Objection 2  
Applies To: 
Comments: 
Provide further details around how and when the expected mileage within each radius classification can 
change or be updated for a particular vehicle. In particular, clarify whether the expected mileage within 
each radius can change 
1.) On midterm amendment 
2.) On audit 
3.) On renewal or rewrite. 
Revise and supersede as necessary. 
 
Our practice is not to update the expected mileage on midterm amendment or audits. The information 
is updated on renewal or rewrite. 
 
Objection 3 
Applies To: 
Comments: 
The previous response to objection 4 is viewed as incomplete. The attached lift chart shows the lift using 
quintiles, but the factors vary down to the centile level. Provide additional details and support for the 
specific tier factors. Include all data, methods, and assumptions used in selecting the tier factors. 
 
Tier factors can be found in the score -to-tier mapping table, where the model score is the product of 
scores by components (Prior Carrier Length, Commercial Credit Score, Driver-Power-Unit Combination, 
Average Number of Relevant Claims, FMCSA Quality Score, Dump Indicator, and Intermodal Indicator). 
The column “Tier Factor” uses the identical values from the previously approved tier model, and the 
columns “Lower Bound” and “Upper Bound” are obtained by shifting the values of the same columns 
from the previously approved tier model in such a way that the overall tier factor impact on the in -force 
book is neutral, i.e., the aggregate ISO loss cost before tier factors applied equals  the aggregate loss 
cost after tier factors applied. 
A refined lift chart is attached below. Bins are created with policies ordered by the tier factors from low 
to high so that each has as least about 1% of the total loss costs. The orange line is the average actual",1.0,correspondence,0.95,
70,"loss residual relativity, while the green one is the average predicted loss residual relativity. The strong 
consistency between actual and predicted demonstrates the efficacy of the tier model. Reversals can 
be attributed to randomness and the smaller volume of data in some tier buckets.
