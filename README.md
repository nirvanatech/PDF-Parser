This code is a two-step PDF parser and classifier for insurance regulatory filings. Here’s what it does:

Extracts Text from PDF:

Reads a PDF file page by page using pypdf.
Extracts text from each page and stores it in a DataFrame.
Classifies Each Page:

Uses OpenAI’s GPT model to classify each page into a category (bucket) such as "factor table", "rule", "form", etc.
Handles blank pages and pages containing "redline" text with rule-based logic before calling the API.
Saves the classification results (including confidence and explanation) to a CSV file.
Extracts Factor Tables:

Identifies pages classified as "factor table".
Groups consecutive factor table pages, combines their text, and sends it to the OpenAI API to extract structured tables.
Each table is saved as a separate sheet in an Excel file, with sheet names based on the company and table title.
Organizes Output:

Creates a dedicated output folder for each PDF processed.
Stores the classified CSV and extracted tables Excel file in this folder.
Logging:

Logs progress and errors throughout the process for transparency and debugging.
Main script flow:

User specifies the input PDF.
Output paths are dynamically generated.
The script runs classification and table extraction sequentially.
Results are saved and logged.
Summary:
This script automates the extraction, classification, and tabular structuring of insurance filing PDFs using AI, saving results in organized output files.
